<span style="font-weight:bold;">DESCRIPTION</span>
        In the beginning ~Sangar& wrote <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">OpenOS</span>, and it was stable, and it had features, and there was little fun.  And <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">OpenOS</span> was rewritten by ~Payonel&, and it had more features, and it was more stable, and there was slightly more fun.

        Then there was <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel</span>, and it had no features, and it was stable, and there was much rejoicing.

        And behold, then there came a new operating system called <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel 2</span>, and it had features, and it was stable, and there was more rejoicing.  And <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel 2</span> thought to itself, <span style="font-weight:bold;">what do the people want?</span>, and the people wanted <span style="color:0x00FF00;">config</span>, and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel 2</span> added <span style="color:0x00FF00;">config</span>, and there was still more rejoicing.  And <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel 2</span> supported <span style="color:0x00FF00;">config</span>, and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel</span> did not support <span style="color:0x00FF00;">config</span>, and thus came OS-dependence and to <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel 2</span> the ~Developer& sent features, but to <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel</span> he sent not features.  And there was some confusion.

        And the people said, let us make fun of the ~Developer& and refer to <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel 2</span> as "an unstable poorly-debugged mess" (which it was), and the ~Developer& was angry.  And so the ~Developer& made a new OS, which he called <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Proton</span>, and Proton was the name of a Steam extension, and there was confusion, and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Photon</span> became known as <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Photon</span>. And <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Photon</span> supported <span style="color:0x00FF00;">config</span>, but did not support anything else, and the ~Developer& was happy, but the people were confused.

        And ~Payonel& sold <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">OpenOS</span> with OpenComputers, and it was better than Photon, and the fiftieth OS war raged upon the land.  And behold, <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Photon</span> was killed, and there was much rejoicing from ~Payonel&.  But the ~Developer& wrote a new operating system, and he called it <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Monolith</span>, and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Monolith</span> was a new OS, and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Monolith</span> was good.

        And <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Monolith</span> was good, and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Photon</span> was not, and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Monolith</span> was given features and support, and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Photon</span> and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel 2</span> and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Open Kernel</span> were not.  And the OS world was a complete mess, and everyone wrote code for everyone else, and confusion abounded.
