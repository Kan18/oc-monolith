        Lua - the Lua programming language

*OVERVIEW/INTRODUCTION</span>
        This manual page attempts to give an overview of the basics of Lua.  It assumes that the reader has previous experience with programming and is familiar with <span style="font-weight:bold;">if</span>/<span style="font-weight:bold;">else</span> blocks, <span style="font-weight:bold;">while</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">for</span> loops; in essence, the basics of computer programming.  I do NOT attempt to teach the basic grounding concepts of programming which I have previously mentioned.

        For complete function documentation on the Lua programming language, see <span style="color:0x00AAFF;"></span>.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">THE LANGUAGE</span>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Types</span>
            Lua provides six basic types: <span style="font-weight:bold;">string</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">table</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">number</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">function</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">boolean</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold;">nil</span>.  A seventh type, <span style="font-weight:bold;">userdata</span>, is sometimes used but will not be covered here.

        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Global Environment</span>
            Lua's global environment takes the form of a table (see below).  This simpifies program flow and allows for easier sandbox creation (more on this later).

        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Variables</span>
            In Lua, unless explicitly declared as <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">local</span>, all variables are global - that is, not affected by scope.  Local variables are usually faster to access, and are lighter on memory as they are cleared when the scope is exited and garbage-collected.

            Variable names can contain any combination, except certain reserved keywords, of alphanumeric characters plus the underscore.  Variable names may not begin with a number and may be of any practical length - in my testing I was able to assign a roughly 28,700-character variable name.

        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Tables</span>
            Lua's tables are simple collections of key-value pairs, similar to Python's <span style="font-weight:bold;">dictionary</span> or, loosely, C's <span style="font-weight:bold;">struct</span>.  Both keys and values can be of any type.

            Tables are declared using curly braces (<span style="font-weight:bold;">{}</span>) and indexed using square braces (<span style="font-weight:bold;">[]</span>).  Table keys provide value indices, and if a key is a syntactically valid variable name it can be indexed with the syntax <span style="font-weight:bold;">table</span>.<span style="font-weight:bold;">key</span> rather than <span style="font-weight:bold;">table</span>[<span style="font-weight:bold;">key</span>].

        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Metatables</span>
            Metatables are tables containing specific fields which declare otherwise undefined behavior on certain objects.  Excepting tables, every type has a single shared metatable which cannot be changed (except through <span style="font-weight:bold;">debug.setmetatable</span>, which is not available in OpenComputers).

            For example, metatables may be used to implement object-oriented programming (see the <span style="font-weight:bold;">class</span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;">3</span>) library included with Monolith).

            Monolith facilitates using the <span style="font-weight:bold;">__type</span> field of metatables to implement custom types, through an override of the <span style="font-weight:bold;">type</span> function in the kernel.

        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Threading</span>

        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Scoping</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">NON-STANDARD LUA APIS PROVIDED BY OPENCOMPUTERS</span>
        OpenComputers provides a few extra APIs and one extra function, to aid in writing programs.  These are the <span style="font-weight:bold;">component</span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;">2</span>) and <span style="font-weight:bold;">computer</span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;">2</span>) APIs, as well as the <span style="color:0x00AAFF;"></span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;">2</span>) function.
