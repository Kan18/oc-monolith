        Monolith - the Monolith Operating System for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod

<span style="font-weight:bold;">DESCRIPTION
        Monolith</span> is an operating system, and collection of utilities for that operating system, written in Lua for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod.  The name is a reference to both the large black box from <span style="font-weight:bold;">2001: A Space Odyssey</span> known as the Monolith and the fact that Monolith is a monolithic kernel.

        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span> draws heavily from the design of the real-world <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">Linux</span> and <span style="color:0xFFFF00;">UNIX</span> operating systems.  It should be largely compatible with real-world Lua programs.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span> includes a selection of other APIs, some of which are defined by the OpenComputers wiki at <span style="color:0x00AAFF;"></span>, such as <span style="color:0x00FF00;">filesystem</span>, <span style="color:0x00FF00;">event</span>, or <span style="color:0x00FF00;">serializatioon</span>, and others which are defined solely from a utility perspective, such as <span style="color:0x00FF00;">config</span> or <span style="color:0x00FF00;">users</span>.

        On boot, the user will be presented with a login prompt.  If installing from Git, the default root credentials are ~root& and ~root&.

        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span> features a mostly ANSI/VT100-compatible terminal, supporting many common, and some uncommon, escape codes.  The VT100 emulator supports bright colors through adding 60 to the color;  for example, ~\27[37m& (normal-white) would become ~\27[97m& (bright-white).  For additional information, see <span style="font-weight:bold;">vt100</span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;">4</span>)

<span style="font-weight:bold;">NOTES</span>
        When Monolith is installed through the OpenOS installer, a user account will be set up and the root password set.
