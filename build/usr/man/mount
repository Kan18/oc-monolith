\27[97mDESCRIPTION\27[37m
        All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at /. These files can be spread out over several devices. The \27[97mmount\27[37m command serves to attach the filesystem found at some address to the big file tree. Conversely, the \27[97mumount\27[37m command will detach it again. The filesystem is used to control how data is stored on the device.

        The standard form of the \27[97mmount\27[37m command is:

                \27[97mmount\27[37m `device` `dir`

        This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem whose address begins with `device` at the directory `dir`.
